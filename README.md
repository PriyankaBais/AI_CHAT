# Chat AI Application

This is a simple and interactive React-based AI Chat application that allows users to type questions and get AI-generated answers dynamically.

## Project Overview

The application provides a clean and user-friendly interface where users can enter a question or query in a textarea, click a button to generate an answer, and view the response below. The AI answer is fetched asynchronously from an API using Axios.

## Features

- **Real-time user input:** Users can type questions or prompts in the textarea.
- **Dynamic answer generation:** Upon clicking the "Generate Answer" button, the app sends the input to an AI service and displays the generated response.
- **Loading state:** Displays a loading message while waiting for the AI response.
- **Simple and elegant UI:** Built with React and styled with CSS for a clean look.
- Responsive layout centered on the page with modern styling.

## Technologies Used

- React for building the UI components.
- Vite as the build tool for fast development.
- CSS for styling, including smooth transitions and responsive layout.
